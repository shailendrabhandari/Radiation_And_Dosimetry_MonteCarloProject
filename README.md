# Radiation_And_Dosimetry

Monte Carlo Method (MCM) is widely used for solving the radiation transport problem. This technique is based on the simulation of history of particle
which account for the energy transfer mechanism. Monte Carlo simulation needs a voluminous quantity of random numbers in the range [0,1] and the
probability density function.Applications range from solving problems in theoretical physics to predicting trends in financial investments.This report briefly describes the Monte Carlo simulation of random number generator and the transport of radiation through matter (water) with only Comptom Scattering interaction between the energy range of 200 keV and 2 MeV.

This project consists of solution to the problem given in
